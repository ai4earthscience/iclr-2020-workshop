# Participating in the #ai4earth

Thank you for your interest in the #ai4earth workshop at ICLR! 

Our virtual conference streams from 7am-4pm PDT on April 26th, 2020.  

Due to technical limitations, this workshop will have two tiers of attendees: general attendees and invited guests. 

### Workshop Audience:

Most folks joining us from ICLR will join the [livestream](https://slideslive.com/38926826/ai-for-earth-sciences) "audience"  from 7am-4pm PDT on April 26th, 2020. The audience will be able to ask text questions of our speakers via rocket.chat or our [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/ai4earth/shared_invite/zt-e30wpddc-lVNgNthtO_HYQOmR0Id~yQ) channel #asktheauthor. Our session moderators will verbally ask submitted questions to the speakers over zoom during the Q&A period after each pre-recorded talk. Links to individual talks will be available soon.  The entire livestream will be available after the conference is completed. 

Registration to the main ICLR conference is encouraged as it will give you access to additional conference content, however it is not required to view the workshop's livestream. Please see the [ICLR website](https://iclr.cc/Register/view-registration) for more details.  

### [SPEAKERS and INVITED GUESTS](https://ai4earthscience.github.io/iclr-2020-workshop/speakers.html)

[Workshop speakers and a limited number of invited panelists](https://github.com/ai4earthscience/iclr-2020-workshop/edit/master/speakers.html) should have received an email in the days preceding the workshop inviting them to a private zoom conference room. These folks are encouraged to join the zoom meeting and ask questions of the speakers live during Q&A sessions by "raising" their hands. Please thoroughly read additional details [here](https://ai4earthscience.github.io/iclr-2020-workshop/speakers.html). 

*Zoom attendees must completely close the livestream before joining the zoom conference (seriously - you will regret it if you don't)*

For questions, message us on #asktheorganizers on [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/ai4earth/shared_invite/zt-e30wpddc-lVNgNthtO_HYQOmR0Id~yQ).
