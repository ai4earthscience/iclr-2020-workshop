# Participating in the #ai4earth

Thank you for your interest in the #ai4earth workshop at ICLR! 

Our virtual conference streams from 7am-4pm PDT on April 26th, 2020.  

Due to technical limitations, this workshop will have two tiers of attendees: general attendees and invited guests. 
Everyone should join the livestream on the main workshop page or the slideslive link. Speaker and invited guests have the ability to ask questions directly on zoom in the Q&A session after each video (zoom users must close the livestream to prevent interference before unmuting).

Everyone will be able to ask text questions of our speakers via rocket.chat or our [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/ai4earth/shared_invite/zt-e30wpddc-lVNgNthtO_HYQOmR0Id~yQ) channel #asktheauthor. Our session moderators will verbally ask submitted questions to the speakers over zoom during the Q&A period after each pre-recorded talk. 

Registration to the main ICLR conference is encouraged as it will give you access to additional conference content, however it is not required to view the workshop's livestream. Please see the [ICLR website](https://iclr.cc/Register/view-registration) for more details.  

*Speakers: Please thoroughly read additional details [here](https://ai4earthscience.github.io/iclr-2020-workshop/speakers.html). *

*Zoom attendees must completely close the livestream before unmuting their audio on the zoom conference (seriously - you will regret it if you don't)*

For questions, message us on #asktheorganizers on [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/ai4earth/shared_invite/zt-e30wpddc-lVNgNthtO_HYQOmR0Id~yQ).
