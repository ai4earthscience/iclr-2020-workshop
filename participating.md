### ICLR attendees and the general public:

Most folks joining us from ICLR are considered "general attendees" and will watch via the slideslive [livestream](https://slideslive.com/38926826/ai-for-earth-sciences) from 7am-4pm PDT on April 26th, 2020. General attendees will ask be able to ask questions of speakers via rocket.chat or our [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/ai4earth/shared_invite/zt-e30wpddc-lVNgNthtO_HYQOmR0Id~yQ) channel #asktheauthor. Questions collected in these chat channels will be asked by session moderators over zoom during the Q&A period after each pre-recorded talk is streamed. Links to individual recordings will be available soon.  

### [SPEAKERS and INVITED GUESTS](https://ai4earthscience.github.io/iclr-2020-workshop/speakers.html)
